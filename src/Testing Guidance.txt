   - Click on a task to mark it as completed.
   - Verify that the task appearance changes to indicate completion.

4. **Input Validation:**

   - Try adding a task with only whitespace characters.
   - Verify that the application does not allow adding invalid tasks.

5. **Dynamic Display:**
   - Add multiple tasks to the list.
   - Verify that all tasks are displayed dynamically without manual page refresh.

6. **Sorting (Optional):**

8. **Local Storage Integration:**
   - Add some tasks to the list.
   - Refresh the page or close and reopen the browser.
   - Verify that the tasks persist after the page reload due to local storage integration.

9. **Cross-browser Compatibility:**
   - Test the application in different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
   - Verify that all features work as expected in each browser.

10. **Responsive Design:**
